# V2UnityDiscordIntercept

V2Unity is a recreation of Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense in Unity3D. The recreation depended on the Discord Game SDK, which is being discontinued. As the source of version 1.43 has not been uploaded, it cannot be rewritten to account for the Discord Game SDK shutdown.

This project is an attempt to rewrite the bits of the game that used the Discord Game SDK to use a standard networking library, allowing direct connections.
